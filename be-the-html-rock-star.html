			<p>Picture perfect memories scattered all around the floor.
				Reaching for the phone 'cause I can't fight it anymore.</p>
			<p>And I wonder if I ever cross your mind? For me it happens all the time.</p>
			<br />
			<p>It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now. Said I wouldn't call but I've lost all control and I need you now.
				And I don't know how I can do without. I just need you now.</p>
			<p>Another shot of whiskey, can't stop looking at the door. Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before.</p>
			<p>And I wonder if I ever cross your mind? For me it happens all the time.<p>
			<br />
			<p>It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk and I need you now. Said I wouldn't call but I've lost all control and I need you now.
				And I don't know how I can do without. I just need you now.</p>
			<p>Oh, whoa. Guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all.</p>
			<br />
			<p>It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now. And I said I wouldn't call but I'm a little drunk and I need you now.
				And I don't know how I can do without. I just need you now.</p> 
			<p>I just need you now. Oh, baby, I need you now.</p>

			<h2>Beyond The Song</h2>
			<p>- The lyrics describe placing a call to someone in the middle of the night due to being lonely and longing for companionship. </p>
			<p>- Hillary Scott commented on the song, saying that <q>All three of us know what it's like to get to that point where you feel lonely enough that you make a late night phone call that you very well could regret the next day.</q></p> 
			<p>- Charles Kelley told The Boot that the band's record executives initially had concerns regarding using the lyrics "I'm a little drunk", but convinced the executives to leave the content in the song.</p>
