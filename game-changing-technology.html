The whole world seemed to be crazy about this skinny creature, which was said to be <q>bigger than bigger</q>. Thousands of people lined up for days and nights just for owning it earlier. The new iPhone is truly the combination of the most advanced technologies and industrial design. However, few people still remember what a phone originally was or looked like. Phones are developing and evolving every day, but we should not forget it's most principal function -- <em>making phone calls</em>.</p>

						<p>A <dfn>telephone, or phone</dfn>, is a telecommunications device that permits two or more users to conduct a conversation when they are not in the same vicinity of each other to be heard directly. That is basically a process from voice to electronic signals and back to voice. You might feel this is nothing surprising, but it was really a magnificent development at that time. Who invented telephone, which was frequently disrupted, is not really important. As this invention was eventually work of many people, let's just remember some of them: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bourseul">Charles Bourseul</a>, the French engineer, who wrote the first design of a telephone in a public memorandum in 1854;  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Graham_Bell">Alexander Graham Bell</a>, who was the first to be awarded a patent for the electric telephone by <abbr title="the United States Patent and Trademark Office">USPTO</abbr> in March 1876, and many others.</p>
						<p>Thanks to the great work of these people, the communication between people became much easier, and the world became much smaller. Almost every person on the earth is benefiting from this great invention, no matter which kind of phone they are using, <em>it is indispensable</em>!<p>
